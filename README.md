# Vaccine-associated-enhanced-respiratory-pathology-in-COVID-19-hamsters-after-TH2-biased-immunization
This is the GitHub repository providing access to all the code used in the analysis of the bulk RNA sequencing and single cell RNA sequencing data in the manuscript "Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory pathology in COVID-19 hamsters after TH2-biased immunization". Code utilised for analysis of scRNAseq data is in the folder "scRNAseq", while the code used to analyse the bulk RNA sequencing data is in the folder "BulkRNAseq". 

For scRNAseq analysis, the code has been separated into four segments and the order in which the data has been processed is indicated by a prepended number, i.e. "1_", "2_" and so on. For bulk RNAseq, all of the analysis and the code for creation of the visualisations is contained within one R script.
